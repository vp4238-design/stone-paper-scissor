## How it works
The design uses four main states to control the game:
State Name	Binary Code	Description
S_IDLE	000	Waiting for the start signal.
S_EVALUATE	001	Evaluates the moves of both players.
S_RESULT	010	Displays the result (Winner, Tie, or Invalid).
S_RESET	011	Resets the game back to the idle state.
The module continuously monitors player inputs.
When start = 1, the FSM moves from S_IDLE → S_EVALUATE → S_RESULT.
The output winner shows the game result.
The FSM stays in S_RESULT until start = 0, which returns it to S_IDLE.

## How to test
Setup
Load the Verilog design into a simulator such as:
Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Vivado.
Connect appropriate clock and reset signals.
Steps
Apply reset = 1 for at least one clock cycle to initialize the FSM.
Set reset = 0.
Provide valid moves to p1_move and p2_move.
Set start = 1 to evaluate moves.
Observe winner and debug outputs.
Set start = 0 to return to S_IDLE.
